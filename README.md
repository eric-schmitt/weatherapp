# weatherapp
This is an app which presents the next five days of weather in 3 hour intervals.

# Items I would have changed had time permitted:
-I would have created an abstraction for the API to make the API calls more reusable.  
-I ignored localization for this project.  
-WeatherData is converted to strings and back, maybe make this parsable.  
-The object name List in the POJO is not very well named. I would go back and change that.  
-It could really use some styling.  
-Display times are pretty ugly. Making it more human-readable would be good.  
-Added more Unit Tests.
-Integration and UI Tests!
